'''
Set in Python (Easy Definition)

A set in Python is a collection of unique, unordered elements.

Unique → No duplicates allowed

Unordered → No index, no fixed position

Mutable → You can add or remove items

Uses { } curly braces

example:
s = {1, 2, 3, 3, 4}
print(s)   # Output: {1, 2, 3, 4}  (duplicate 3 removed)

Key Points:

Set items must be immutable (numbers, strings, tuples).
Sets are useful for removing duplicates, 
mathematical operations like union, intersection, difference.
