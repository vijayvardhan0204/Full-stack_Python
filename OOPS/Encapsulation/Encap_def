#  ✅ Encapsulation in Python
# Definition

# Encapsulation means wrapping data (variables) and methods (functions) into a single unit (class) and controlling access to that data using access modifiers.

# In simple words:
# 👉 Hide the data inside the class and allow access only through methods. 

# ✅ Why Encapsulation?

# To protect data from accidental modification

# To control how data is accessed

# To avoid misuse of variables

# To follow OOP principles

# To create secure and clean code 

#  ✅ Access Modifiers in Python

# Python provides 3 types of variable/method access: 

#  1️⃣ Public (name)

# Accessible everywhere 

class Student:
    def __init__(self):
        self.name = "Vijay"   # public variable

s = Student()
print(s.name)

#  2️⃣ Protected (_name)

# Should NOT be used outside the class (but Python allows it)

class Student:
    def __init__(self):
        self._marks = 90  # protected

s = Student()
print(s._marks)   # possible but not recommended

# 3️⃣ Private (__name)

# Cannot be accessed directly

# Python performs name-mangling 

class Student:
    def __init__(self):
        self.__password = "abcd1234"  # private
    
    def show(self):
        print(self.__password)

s = Student()
# print(s.__password)  ❌ Error

s.show()  # ✔ accessible through method
