What is Abstraction in Python?

Abstraction means hiding unnecessary details and showing only the important features.

It helps you use an object without knowing how it works internally.

👉 Example from real life:
You use a mobile phone to call someone.
You don’t know what wires, chips, circuits are working inside → those details are hidden.
You see only the buttons, apps, and touchscreen → important things are shown.

Same in Python.

✅ Why Abstraction?

Reduces complexity

Improves code readability

Gives security to data

You focus only on “what to do”, not “how it is done”

✅ How to Achieve Abstraction in Python?

Python gives abstraction using:

✔ 1. Abstract Classes
✔ 2. Abstract Methods

These are provided by the abc module (Abstract Base Class).

✅ When to Use Abstraction?

Use abstraction when:

You want to force child classes to implement a method

You want a common interface for all subclasses

You want to hide unnecessary code
