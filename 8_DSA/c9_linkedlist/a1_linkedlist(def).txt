✅ What is a Linked List?

A Linked List is a data structure made of nodes, where each node stores:

data/value

link (pointer) to next node


Unlike arrays/lists:

❌ They are not stored in continuous memory

✔️ They are dynamic (grow/shrink easily)

✔️ Insertion/Deletion is fast (O(1)) when you know the node

✅ Types of Linked Lists

Singly Linked List → each node points to next

Doubly Linked List → next + previous pointers

Circular Linked List → last node points back to head
