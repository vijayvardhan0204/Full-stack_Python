# Given an unsorted array arr[] with both positive and negative elements, find the smallest positive number missing from the array.

# Examples:

# Input: arr[] = [2, -3, 4, 1, 1, 7]
# Output: 3
# Explanation: 3 is the smallest positive number missing from the array.

# Input: arr[] = [5, 3, 2, 5, 1]
# Output: 4
# Explanation: 4 is the smallest positive number missing from the array.

# Input: arr[] = [-8, 0, -1, -4, -3]
# Output: 1 
# Explanation: 1 is the smallest positive number missing from the array.




def missingNumber(arr):
    # Length of the array
    n = len(arr)

    # Step 1: Cyclic sort
    # Place each number x at index x-1 if it lies in range [1, n]
    for i in range(n):
        # Keep swapping until:
        # 1) arr[i] is in range [1, n]
        # 2) arr[i] is not already at its correct position
        while 1 <= arr[i] <= n and arr[i] != arr[arr[i] - 1]:
            # Correct index for value arr[i]
            correct_index = arr[i] - 1

            # Swap arr[i] with the element at its correct index
            arr[i], arr[correct_index] = arr[correct_index], arr[i]

    # Step 2: Find the first index where value is incorrect
    # If arr[i] != i+1, then i+1 is the missing number
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if i != arr[i - 1]:
            return i

    # If all numbers from 1 to n are present,
    # then the missing number is n+1
    return n + 1
