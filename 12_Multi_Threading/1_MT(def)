Multithreading = Running multiple tasks concurrently in the same program using multiple threads.

A thread is like a small worker inside your program that can run code independently.


Why use Multithreading?

You use multithreading when you want to perform tasks that involve waiting, such as:

Downloading files

Making API calls

Reading/writing files

Doing background tasks

Handling multiple users (like in servers)

⚠️ Important Note — GIL

Python has a Global Interpreter Lock (GIL), which means:

Only one thread can execute Python code at a time

Multithreading does NOT speed up CPU-heavy tasks

But it does help for I/O-bound tasks (network, file, waiting).
