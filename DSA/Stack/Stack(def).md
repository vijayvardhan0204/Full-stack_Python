# Stack

1.A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle.

2.Think of it like a stack of pancakes - you can only add or remove pancakes from the top.

# Stacks
1. A stack is a data structure that can hold many elements, and the last element added is the first one to be removed.

2. Like a pile of pancakes, the pancakes are both added and removed from the top. So when removing a pancake, it will always be the last pancake you added. This way of organizing elements is called LIFO: Last In First Out.

3. Basic operations we can do on a stack are:

<!-- Push: Adds a new element on the stack.
Pop: Removes and returns the top element from the stack.
Peek: Returns the top (last) element on the stack.
isEmpty: Checks if the stack is empty.
Size: Finds the number of elements in the stack.
Stacks can be implemented by using arrays or linked lists. -->

4. Stacks can be used to implement undo mechanisms, to revert to previous states, to create algorithms for depth-first search in graphs, or for backtracking.
