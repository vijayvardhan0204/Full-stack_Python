Polymorphism means “many forms.”
In Python, the same function name or operator can work in different ways depending on the object or data type.

Python supports 3 main types of polymorphism:

1. Method Overriding (Run-time Polymorphism)

When a child class redefines a method of the parent class.

2. Polymorphism with Same Method Names (Duck Typing)

Even without inheritance, if different classes have the same method, Python allows calling them in a loop.

3. Operator Overloading (Special Methods)

Operators like +, -, * can be customized for classes.

Simple One-Line Difference

Overloading → Same method name, different parameters (not supported in Python).
Overriding → Child class replaces parent’s method (supported in Python).
