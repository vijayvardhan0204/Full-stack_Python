# ✅ 1. Class

# A class is a blueprint/template for creating objects.

# It groups data (variables) and actions (methods) together.

# Example:
class Student:
    pass


# A class does not occupy memory until objects are created.

# ✅ 2. Object

# An object is an instance of a class.

# It has its own data and can use the class's methods.

# Example:
s1 = Student()   # object 1
s2 = Student()   # object 2
# Each object has separate memory.



# ✅ 3. Types of Variables in Python OOP
# A. Instance Variables

# Specific to each object

# Defined inside constructor or methods using self.variable

# Example:
class Student:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name      # instance variable
        self.age = age        # instance variable


# Each object will have its own name and age.

# B. Class Variables (Static Variables)

# Shared by all objects

# Defined inside class but outside methods

# Example:
class Student:
    school = "ABC School"    # class variable

    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name


# All objects share the same value of school.


# C. Local Variables
# Variables declared inside a method
# Only accessible inside that method
# Example:
class Demo:
    def show(self):
        x = 10   # local variable
        print(x)

# x cannot be accessed outside show().

# ✅ 4. Types of Methods in Python OOP

# Python supports 3 types of methods:

# A. Instance Methods

# Take self as the first parameter

# Can access instance variables

# Example:
class Student:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

    def display(self):      # instance method
        print("Name:", self.name)

# B. Class Methods

# Use @classmethod decorator

# First parameter is cls

# Can access class variables

# Example:
class Student:
    school = "ABC School"

    @classmethod
    def show_school(cls):
        print(cls.school)

# C. Static Methods

# Use @staticmethod

# No self or cls

# Used for utility functions

# Example:
class Math:
    @staticmethod
    def add(a, b):
        return a + b

# ✅ 5. Constructors in Python

# Constructor in Python = __init__() method
# It runs automatically when an object is created.

# Purpose:

# Initialize instance variables

# Example:
class Student:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age

# Complete Example Covering Everything
class Student:
    school = "ABC School"      # class variable

    def __init__(self, name, age):   # constructor
        self.name = name             # instance variable
        self.age = age

    def display(self):               # instance method
        print(f"Name: {self.name}, Age: {self.age}")

    @classmethod
    def show_school(cls):            # class method
        print("School:", cls.school)

    @staticmethod
    def welcome():                   # static method
        print("Welcome to the student portal!")

# Usage:
s1 = Student("Vijay", 21)

s1.display()
Student.show_school()
Student.welcome()



# Class – Blueprint containing variables + methods.

# Object – Instance of class; has separate memory.

# Types of Variables

# Instance Variable – unique per object

# Class Variable – shared by all objects

# Local Variable – exists only inside method

# Types of Methods

# Instance Method (self)

# Class Method (cls)

# **Static Method (@staticmethod)

# Constructor – __init__() automatically runs, initializes object.
